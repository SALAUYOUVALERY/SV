It's such a warm place,
But there on the street,
Where our footprints are waited for,
Stardusted boots
Sparkle and shine.
Here are the shepherds and upholstered chair,
Dazzling dreams below the bright sun, orb,
The trigger untouched
When it was the right time.
I am able to pay, but I never want
A triumph at any price,
I never want
Someone's chest lying under my foot.
I would rather stay here with you,
Just to stay here with you,
But the star which is high in the skies
Still gives me the route.
